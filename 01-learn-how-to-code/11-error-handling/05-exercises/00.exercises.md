# GoLang Exercises #11 - "Error handling"

## Hands-on exercise #1
  Start with [this code](https://play.golang.org/p/3W69TH4nON).
  Instead of using the blank identifier, make sure the code is checking and handling the error.

  solution:
    ● https://play.golang.org/p/tn8oiuL1Yn

## Hands-on exercise #2
  Start with [this code](https://play.golang.org/p/9a1IAWy5E6).
  Create a custom error message using “fmt.Errorf”.

  solution:
    ● https://play.golang.org/p/HugU4HJEEO
    ● https://play.golang.org/p/NII-lmGasj
    ● https://play.golang.org/p/Vo5kIoR-sG

## Hands-on exercise #3
  Create a struct “customErr” which implements the builtin.error interface.
  Create a func “foo” that has a value of type error as a parameter.
  Create a value of type “customErr” and pass it into “foo”.
  If you need a hint, [here is one](https://play.golang.org/p/L5QWV8-p11).

  solution:
    ● https://play.golang.org/p/ixeowY2fd2
    ● assertion
      ○ https://play.golang.org/p/pbl2kCYsM0
    ● conversion
      ○ https://play.golang.org/p/1ldiBdkdzA

## Hands-on exercise #4
  Starting with [this code](https://play.golang.org/p/wlEM1tgfQD), use the sqrt.Error struct as a value of type error.
  If you would like, use these numbers for your:
    ● lat "50.2289 N"
    ● long "99.4656 W"

  solution:
    ● https://play.golang.org/p/nsRxbDfkCh

## Hands-on exercise #5
  We are going to learn about testing next.
  For this exercise, take a moment and see how much you can figure out about testing by reading the [testing documentation](http://godoc.org/testing) & also [Caleb Doxsey’s article on testing](http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/12).
  See if you can get a basic example of testing working.
