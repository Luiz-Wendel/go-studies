## Hands-on exercise #1
  Start with [this code](https://github.com/GoesToEleven/go-programming/tree/master/code_samples/010-ninja-level-thirteen/01/starting-code).
  Get the code ready to BET on the code (add benchmarks, examples, tests).

  Run the following in this order:
    ● tests
    ● benchmarks
    ● coverage
    ● coverage shown in web browser
